# CRM-Database-Analysis_Externship

Includes a portion of my 5 member team's final code. 

Our goal was to optimize our pharmaceutical company's CRM Database, with the intent of improved marketing efforts through a better understanding of their customer base. As the CRM was populated by client-filled forms, our job was to standardize names, institutions, etc. and fill out any missing information that was scrapable. We also utilized Tableau to showcase the changes in the data, and the increase in efficiency. In the end, we were able to establish a successful standardized bucketing system for the company, which can be leveraged to better understand client's needs.

Database not included to protect client privacy.
